    <h1>NAME CEREMONY</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A naming ceremony is a stage at which a person or persons is officially assigned a name. The methods of the
      practice differ over cultures and religions. The timing at which a name is assigned can vary from some days
      after birth to several months or many years.</p>
    <p>the Namkaran ceremony is conducted after the 'Jatakarma' samskara, a rite of passage celebrating the child's
      birth. Nowadays, with more and more births taking place in the hospital, this ritual has become a part of the
      Namkaran ceremony, and both are performed together within a few weeks of the baby's birth.</p>
    <p>the naming ceremony should be held 11 days after birth immediately preceding the 'Sutika' or 'Shuddhikaran'
      period when the mother and child are confined to intensive post-partum or post-natal care. However, the 11th day
      is not fixed and can be decided by the parents based on a priest or an astrologer's advice, and can be delayed
      even up to the baby's first birthday.</p>
    <p>The mother and father start the Namkaran ritual with pranayama, prayers, and mantra chanting in the presence of
      the family priest. In the absence of the father, the grandfather or uncle can perform the ritual. The priest
      performs the ritual with prayers to the Gods, Agni, the god of fire, the elements, and the spirits of the
      ancestors.</p>
    <p>Rice grains are spread on a bronze 'thali' or dish and the father writes the chosen name in it using a gold stick
      while chanting the God's name. Then he whispers the name into the child's right ear, repeating it four times along
      with a prayer. All others present repeat a few words after the priest to formally accept the name. This is
      followed by the blessings of the elders along with gifts, and the ritual ends with a feast with family and
      friends. Usually, the family astrologer also presents the child's horoscope at this ceremony.</p>
    <p>The beauty of a naming ceremony is that you can design it however you like â€“ there are no legal requirements and
      restrictions, so it can be fully tailored to your wants and needs.</p>
