	<h1>BABY SHOWER</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>When a baby is on the way, the parents aren’t the only ones that get excited. Odds are that the future grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, friends, and other loved ones will also be eager to welcome the newest member of the family. A baby shower is one of the most traditional ways in which your loved ones come together to express their joy at your pregnancy.</p>
  <p>A baby shower is basically a party which is thrown to celebrate the impending birth of a new baby. It’s also a way for friends and family to help the new parents get everything they need. After all, babies need tons of stuff, and the list can get quite expensive!</p>
  <p>You might not know this, but the baby showers we know are a relatively new invention. But that doesn’t mean that giving gifts to expectant parents wasn’t done before baby showers became popular. New babies have always been a source of joy and celebration — but in past times, these celebrations were very different from what we know today.</p>
  <p>Ancient Greeks and Egyptians held rituals to celebrate the new baby and its mother. During these rituals, they also offered gifs and good wishes to different gods and goddesses. During the Middle Ages, the baby’s baptism served as an opportunity to give gifts to the new parents. It was common for gifts to have religious significance, and godparents were usually the ones who gave them.</p>
