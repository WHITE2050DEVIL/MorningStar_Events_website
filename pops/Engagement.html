    <h1>ENGAGEMENT</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>An engagement or betrothal is the period of time between the declaration of acceptance of a marriage proposal and
      the marriage itself which is typically but not always commenced with a wedding. During this period, a couple is
      said to be fianc√©s , betrothed, intended, affianced, engaged to be married, or simply engaged.
      Future brides and grooms may be called feminine or masculine, the betrothed, a wife-to-be or
      husband-to-be, respectively. The duration of the courtship varies vastly, and is largely dependent on cultural
      norms or upon the agreement of the parties involved</p>
    <p>Getting engaged is an official announcement of the intention to marry. With the acceptance of the marriage
      proposal, both partners express their will to marry each other. An engagement is therefore no more and no less
      than the public announcement to marry each other.</p>
    <p>An engagement is an agreement or promise to marry, and also refers to the time between proposal and marriage.
      During this time, a couple is said to be affianced, engaged to be married, or simply engaged. An engagement can be
      seen by witnesses to confirm their marriage.</p>
