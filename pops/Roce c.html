    <h1>ROCE CEREMONY</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In this culturally diverse land of ours, the Roce Ceremony is an immensely important pre-wedding ritual for the
      Indian Catholics of Goa and Mangalore that takes place before a Catholic wedding. The Roce Ceremony is celebrated
      by anointing the bride and groom with freshly squeezed coconut milk, also called Ros, meaning juice, which is
      where the word Roce comes from and coconut oil. The Roce Ceremony is the Catholic wedding equivalent of the Haldi
      ceremony in Hindu Weddings and is very near and dear to every Goan and Mangalorean Catholic. </p>
    <p>This unique and interesting tradition has been observed by Goan and Mangalorean Catholics for generations and is
      still celebrated with the very same enthusiasm and vigor. Of course, keeping with the time, people alter a few
      aspects of the Roce Ceremony, but overall it holds just as much importance, and no Goan and Mangalorean Catholic
      wedding is complete without the Roce Ceremony. </p>
    <p>So, if you are on a hunt for ideas for your own Roce Ceremony such as a venue for the Roce Ceremony, decor
      inspiration, outfits, or entertainment, you have come to the right place. This blog presents some endearing ideas
      that will help you turn your Roce Ceremony into an unforgettable affair. So, keep reading brides and grooms-to-be!
    </p>
    <p>The Roce Ceremony, as we mentioned, is the Catholic equivalent of Haldi and signifies the end of bachelorhood and
      spinsterhood for the bride and groom. It is celebrated a couple of days prior to a Catholic wedding and uses
      coconut oil and coconut milk because coconut holds a lot of importance in Goan culture due to its abundant
      availability. From curries to desserts, coconut has found a profound place in Konkani cuisine. Not just that, it
      has also found its place in Konkani traditions and is presented as holy offerings. </p>

    <p>The use of coconut in the Roce Ceremony goes beyond this. Coconuts represent nature and its givings, and
      primarily using coconut for an important pre-wedding ritual signifies that we acknowledge and are grateful for
      everything that mother nature bestows upon us. </p>
