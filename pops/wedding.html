    <h1>WEDDING</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A wedding is a celebration or ceremony of marriage. Besides being a formal way to mark the union of two people,
      weddings can be a lot of fun too.The earliest meaning of wedding was simply "the state of being married," but by
      the early 1400s it meant the
      ceremony or rite at the very beginning of a marriage.</p>
    <p>A wedding can be a simple civil ceremony at City Hall or an elaborate event that takes place over several days
      and involves religious rituals, food and drink, and hundreds of guests. As an adjective, wedding describes
      anything related to the ceremony, like wedding cakes and wedding dresses.</p>
    <p>marriage, a legally and socially sanctioned union, usually between a man and a woman, that is regulated by laws,
      rules, customs, beliefs, and attitudes that prescribe the rights and duties of the partners and accords status to
      their offspring.</p>
    <p>The universality of marriage within different societies and cultures is attributed to the many basic social and
      personal functions for which it provides structure, such as sexual gratification and regulation, division of
      labour between the sexes, economic production and consumption, and satisfaction of personal needs for affection,
      status, and companionship.</p>
      <p>Some form of marriage has been found to exist in all human societies, past and present. Its importance can be seen in the elaborate and complex laws and rituals surrounding it. Although these laws and rituals are as varied and numerous as human social and cultural organizations, some universals do apply</p>
